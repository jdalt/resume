## About Me

I'm an experienced Software Engineer who can build a platform from the ground up and rally a team to support it.
I've been programming since picking up Interplay's [Learn to Program Basic](https://archive.org/details/PCPowerplay-026-1998-07/page/n99/mode/2up) in the late 90s. 
Studied English (Creative Writing), Math, and Film at the University of Wisconsin. Grew up on a dairy farm. I like to make connections between distant ideas and domains.

I'm effective at both fast slinging experiments and incrementally migrating complex systems to new architectures with 0 downtime.
Nearly all of my professional experience is working in start-ups.
I'm the type of person you want on your team when you're modeling new territory or trying to scale out a product from a prototype to a platform.
I like to see things through to completion.
